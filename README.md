# Classroom-Shuffle-2.0
This web-app will allow teachers/instructors to create unique partnerships for different projects among all of their classes.

This is a remake of my previous project Classroom Shuffle. I will turn it into a web-app and use the MERN stack to make it awesome. I will also rewrite the partner creation algorithm so that it is much less awful.
